# STAT 5430 Final Project Report Outline

## 1. Introduction
- Motivation: tone sandhi as a complex, structured prediction problem.
- Goal: compare rule-based vs statistical modeling with simulation.

## 2. Methods
- Synthetic tone sandhi system design.
- Data generation (simulation).
- Rule-based predictor.
- Machine learning models (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest).
- Monte Carlo experiments and robustness checks.

## 3. Results
- Baseline rule-based accuracy.
- ML model performance.
- Stability across runs (Monte Carlo).
- Effect of noise and missing data (if implemented).

## 4. Discussion
- When rule-based is ideal, when ML adds value.
- Limitations of the simulation.
- Connection to phonology project and future work.

## 5. Reproducibility
- GitHub repo + environment.yml
- How to rerun experiments.
