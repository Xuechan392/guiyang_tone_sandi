# Data Directory

This folder will contain:

- `simulated_data_clean.csv` — clean synthetic tone sequences.
- `simulated_data_noisy.csv` — tone sequences with noise injected.
- `simulated_data_missing.csv` — datasets with missing tone labels for robustness experiments.

All datasets are generated programmatically by `src/simulate_data.py`.  
No real speaker data are stored here.
